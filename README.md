# Health Record System

This repository contains a working prototype of a Health Record System with a React frontend and a simple Flask + MongoDB backend. It is provided as a development prototype and is not production-ready.

## Repository layout

- `src/` — React frontend source (Vite + React 18)
- `index.html`, `package.json`, `vite.config.js` — frontend project files
- `backend/` — Flask backend and utility scripts
  - `backend/app.py` — Flask app entry point
  - `backend/config.py` — DB and auth configuration (default `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`)
  - `backend/requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
  - `backend/create_test_users.py` — helper to seed sample admin/doctor users

## Quick start

Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and `npm`
- Python 3.10+ (or compatible)
- MongoDB (local or remote)

1) Clone and install frontend deps

```bash
cd "d:\Ekansh  Files\HRS\Health Record"
npm install
```

2) Prepare a Python virtual environment and install backend deps

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Linux / macOS:

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3) Configure environment (optional)

- `MONGO_URI` — MongoDB connection string (default: `mongodb://localhost:27017/`)
- `JWT_SECRET` — Secret for signing JWTs (default in `config.py` is `change-me-in-prod` — change this for any real use)
- `JWT_EXP_HOURS` — Optional token lifetime (defaults to `1` hour)

You can export these before running the backend, or set them in your environment.

4) Seed demo users (optional)

```bash
cd backend
python create_test_users.py
```

This script will attempt to insert two users if they don't already exist:
- Doctor: `doctor.user@example.com` / `DoctorPass123` (role: `doctor`)
- Admin:  `admin.user@example.com`  / `AdminPass123`  (role: `admin`)

5) Run backend and frontend

Run backend (Flask):

```bash
cd backend
python app.py
# Backend will listen on http://0.0.0.0:5000 by default
```

Run frontend (Vite dev server):

```bash
cd "d:\Ekansh  Files\HRS\Health Record"
npm run dev
# Frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173 (or the port printed by Vite)
```

## API highlights

- `POST /api/auth/register` — register a new user (expects `name`, `email`, `password`, optional `role`)
- `POST /api/auth/login` — authenticate and receive a JWT
- `GET /api/users/me` — (protected) fetch current user profile (requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`)
- `GET /api/health` — simple health endpoint
- `GET|POST /api/db-test` — test endpoints for inserting and listing documents in `test` collection

Note: The backend uses MongoDB via `pymongo` and the database and JWT configuration is controlled in `backend/config.py` (or by the environment variables listed above).

## Frontend notes

- The frontend is a Vite + React app located under `src/` using React Router and a small `AuthContext` for authentication state.
- Scripts available in `package.json`: `dev`, `build`, `preview`.

## Security & Production notes

- This project is a prototype. Before any production deployment you should:
  - Harden authentication and rotate `JWT_SECRET`.
  - Use HTTPS and secure CORS configuration.
  - Validate and sanitize all inputs on the backend.
  - Configure a production-grade MongoDB deployment and credentials.
  - Add logging, monitoring, and backup/restore procedures.

## Helpful commands

Frontend:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # start dev server
npm run build     # production build
npm run preview   # preview the built app
```

Backend:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python create_test_users.py  # optional seed users
python app.py
```

## Contact / next steps

If you want, I can:
- add a `.env.example` file documenting the environment variables
- add a `Procfile` / docker-compose for easier local orchestration
- run a quick smoke test of frontend ↔ backend endpoints (if you want me to run them here)

This README was updated to reflect the actual Flask backend and MongoDB usage present in the `backend/` folder, and to provide accurate run instructions for both frontend and backend.
